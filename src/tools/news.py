        Aggregate news from multiple keyless sources concurrently.

        Sources queried in parallel (all verified working, no authentication
        required):
          - Google News RSS (search, with `when:` freshness operator)
          - Bing News RSS (search, with age filter; uses curl subprocess
            because Bing rejects httpx's TLS fingerprint)
          - The Guardian (full Content API via public "test" key)
          - GDELT 2.0 Doc API (global news index; may be rate-limited to
            one call per 5s per IP — gracefully skipped when throttled)
          - DuckDuckGo News (HTML scrape fallback)

        Results are deduplicated by URL and fuzzy title.

        Args:
            query: News search query
            max_results: Maximum unique results to return (default: 10)
            language: Language code (default: "en") — honored by Google News
            country: Country code (default: "US") — honored by Google News
            time_range: anytime | day | week | month (applied to every
                source that supports native freshness filtering; ignored by
                DuckDuckGo which has no freshness param)
